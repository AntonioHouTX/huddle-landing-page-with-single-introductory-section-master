## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon Library
### What I learned

While I was working on this project, the greatest insight I gained was code simplification.  Sometimes coding is not about re-inventing the wheel.  In the past, I admittedly have tended to overuse CSS Grid when a simpler layout could have accomplished the same goals with less code.  And less code is the bedrock in becoming a clean coder.  For example, in lieu of CSS Grid I used Flexbox for the desktop media query, as demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```css
main {
    display: flex;
  }
```

Not an elaborate or extraordinary approach, I admit.  But far simpler than setting up a messy grid that would have required code tweaking ad infinitum.

### Useful resources

- [CSS background-size property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.asp) - This helped me in getting the background image position just right for the mobile & tablet versions of the site.
